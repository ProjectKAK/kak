Ripe App

Description: 
Ripe is the perfect web application for home cooks or dinner party hosts. Using our filters, users can easily find recipes that includes ingredients that they already have at home. They can keep track of at-home ingredients through their account/profile by manually adding ingredients.

The filters used a combination of AJAX, jQuery, and JavaScript. 

MVP: 
The ability for users to search recipes by ingredient(s) and can filter results. Authorized and authenticated users can create profiles where they can save at-home ingredients as well. Users have a landing page.

Scope:
We planned to build a web application that allowed users to search for recipes by ingredients and have the ability to filter results. We also wanted to strive for everything off of our wishlist and half of us knew, this was not reachable.

Wishlist:
- Implement Foodpairing API so users can see what alcohol beverages are suggested along with the meal(s).
- Implementing Postmates API so users can purchase ingredients and alcoholic beverages that they don't already own through Postmates' web and mobile applications. 
- We wanted to create collections for each user so they can save and organize recipes.
- Lastly, we wanted to add a barcode scanner so not only can users manually search for items that they want to add to their ingredients list, but barcodes can be scanned so ingredients would be automatically included.
